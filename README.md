The Investment Advisor Data Analytics project is a component of the larger Investment Advisor project. Our objective is to analyze large volumes of data related to financial markets, economic trends, and asset performance, to generate insights and recommendations for the new investors to invest in different stocks to grow their wealth.

The Investment Advisor Data Analytics project will involve collecting, cleaning, and organizing financial data from a variety of sources, such as stock exchanges, financial news websites, and economic indicators. The data will then be analyzed using Python libraries to identify patterns and trends, and to generate insights about market conditions and investment opportunities.
